        <p id="bio">I'm a self-taught web developer from a beautiful small town in Worcestershire, UK. I've had an interest in tinkering with web technologies ever since the days of Piczo and Freewebs, and <strong>source:</strong> frequently appeared in my address bar. Most recently I have worked with a large news company within the UK to help deliver data-driven content to millions of monthly readers.</p>
