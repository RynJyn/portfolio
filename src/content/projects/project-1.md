title: Queen Elizabeth II Tribute Page
desc: As part of my work for a large UK news company, I was often tasked with creating pages that allowed readers to post a tribute to someone who had recently passed. One of the most prominent figures I built a page for was Queen Elizabeth II. Alongside this page I provided an internal-use-only moderation tool to help journalists filter through thousands of messages over a very busy 48 hours.
