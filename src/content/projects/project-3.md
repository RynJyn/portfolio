title: Music Streaming Website
desc: Used Inertia.js to stitch together a Vue.js front end combined with a Laravel back end to create a full-stack application that allows users to stream music. Additionally features an administrative CMS for managing catalogue content. Future plans for this project include setting up context-based queueing for tracks, user playlists, and implementing a feature to bring together ChatGPT and Suno.
