title: Fill the Blank
desc: A small project I built to learn React and SASS. 5 well-known phrases (quotes, lyrics etc.) are shown with each having a blank that the player must fill in, selecting one of the 4 options presented. Each correct answer awards 1000 points, but using a hint reduces the available points for that round to only 500.
